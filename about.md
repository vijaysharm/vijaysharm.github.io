I'm just a guy that's addicted to writing code. I do my best to dump thoughts here the best I can. I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/vijaysharm) if you ever want to reach out to me about any specific projects.

You can also have a look at some of my personal apps I have listed in the play store.
