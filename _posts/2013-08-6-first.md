Like all good blogs, this is my hello world. Maybe I'll get rid of it once my page is up and running, but for now, test test test test test test test... welcome :)

This is a test to see how the syntax highlighting works in jekyll

So syntax highlighting doesn't seem to work..
```java
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
public class Utils {
  /**
   * Copied from com.google.gwt.lang.LongLib
   * @param value
   * @return
   */
  public static long longFromBase64(String value) {
    int pos = 0;
  }
}
```
Stupid illegal characters.
