Like all good blogs, this is my hello world. Maybe I'll get rid of it once my page is up and running, but for now, test test test test test test test... welcome :)


This is a test to see how the syntax highlighting works in jekyll


{% highlight java %}
@Singleton
public class SeriesViewer extends Composite implements SeriesViewerPresenter.View
{    
    private static final int SCROLLBAR_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS = 25;

    private List<Layout> createLayoutList()
    {
    	return Lists.newArrayList();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
