title: Animated grid menu transition

Since the last post, I decided I wanted more from the grid menu. I want the menu to animate when a user selects an item, and I want it to animate in a rather cool way. What I was thinking was by clicking an item, all other items fade away, and the item expands to take up the remaining space.
